Thank you so much for taking an interest in my first ever music pack!

Making these tracks took a lot of time, energy, and planning. It would mean the world if you credited me for my work.

If you would like to hire me to make a custom game sound track or other audio for another kind of project, you can
email me at gkmaygenko@gmail.com (or you can DM me on my socials).

Thank you!
