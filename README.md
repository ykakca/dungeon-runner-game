# dungeon-runner-game
This is my first project in Unity, and it's a simple 2D maze-escaping game created for Android devices using Unity.

This game is centered around collecting all the coins in the maze while running away from (or beating) the enemies, and reaching the exit door. 
The player has 1 life, the player dies instantly when an enemy contacts him.
The door opens only after all the coins are collected. 
There are 2 types of potions (power-ups): One gives a speed boost to the player, and the other allows the player to be invincible for a brief amount of time, also allowing the player to kill the enemies on contact. 
There are different types of enemies, each having different speeds.
The game gets progressively more difficult as the player goes through each level, there are 10 levels in total.
